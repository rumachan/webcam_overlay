# webcam_overlay
A series of overlays, containing annotations for webcam images, have been created. These consists of lines and labels on a transparent background. They are stored as a JPEG file.

Purpose: To permit adding an overlay to any webcam image of your choice.

Use case: A GHA finds something interesting on a webcam image and wants to describe/show it to a VDO. They select the image, then the overlay nearest in time, and add the overlay onto the image. The overlayed image can be shown to a VDO, or a GHA can use the annotations to better describe where in an image the interesting thing can be seen.
